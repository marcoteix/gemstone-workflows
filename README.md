# GEMSTONE Workflows

WDL workflows for the GEMSTONE project. Includes workflows to process Illumina paired-end reads from isolates and plate swipes. These workflows are based on the PHB workflows by Theiagen[^1]. Workflows for useful standalone tools are also provided, namely StrainGE for strain level detection, Kraken/Bracken2 for abundance estimation, and metaWRAP for MAG binning and refinement.

This repository also contains DOCKERFILE files for bespoke Docker images used in some WDL tasks.

## Documentation
